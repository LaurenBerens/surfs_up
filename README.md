## Additional weather analysis for June and December over multiple years for surf shop investor including 2-3 recommendations for further analysis.  In summary, June and December's rainfall average and temperature average indicate purpetual pleasant weather for surfing and ice cream!  Additional recommendations would include:
- learning more about station reporting 
- learning more about the location of each station
- collecting additional data from March and September

### Data was collected for the average total amount of monthly rain and grouped by each reporting station.  The mean rainfall (inches) and mean teamperature (F) across all stations for the month of June was 0.124" and 74.9F, respectively.  Rain and undesireable temperatures are a minimal concern for the surf and ice cream shop in the month of June.   This is excellent news!  

### Further, The mean rainfall (inches) and mean teamperature (F) across all stations for the month of December was 0.25" and 71.2F, respectively.  Rain and undesireable temperatures are a minimal concern for the surf and ice cream shop in the month of December.  Rain is still very low and temperature is still pleasant enough to surf and enjoy ice cream!   

## Finally, additional recommendations for enhanced and informed data would include running a query on frequency of data reporting per station.  There is one station in particular (USC00516128) that consistently, for all queried data, provided extreme data points on both high and low ends of the data.  The range of average rainfall across all stations for the month of June was 0.49".  75% of the data provided was below 0.12" of rain, however the range is 0.49".  The only data point provided  above .15 was USC00516128 with avergage monthly rainfall for June was about 0.5".  This is just one data query where this specific station provided skewed data.  One way to prevent skewed data would be to identify how active this data is updated and reported on.  If USC00515128 was provided only once per month, our data is not well rounded and not particularly meaningful or reliable.  Additionally, knowing the location of the station versus the location of the surf/ice cream shop would be beneficial.  For example, if a reporting station is on a different part of Hawaii, the data provided by that station may not be immediately relevant.  Knowing the distance between the station and the shop would be helpful in interpreting data for these decisions.

### Last, I would strongly encourage reviewing data from March and September for a more well rounded understanding of annual data and predict possible dips in sales. due to weather correlated traffic. It sounds like Mr. W. Avey will be thrilled to open the ice cream shop with us!
